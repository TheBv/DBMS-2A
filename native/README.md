# DBMS React-Native APP

This directory contains the code to build and run a react native application that allows the user to create an account and rate questions that were sent to them.

## Setup

Simply run 
```
npm i
```
followed by
```
npm run start
```
This will start a development service to run the app on the web or a mobile device.

## Pre requisites
You will need an expo account, and you will potentially need to update the project id.

**NOTE**: Currently only the **android** build is supported. Importantly you also need to have the backend running locally.
